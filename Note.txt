Run Flask with Gunicorn
You can now start your Flask app using Gunicorn:


gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
Explanation of the Command:
gunicorn → Runs the Gunicorn server.
-w 4 → Uses 4 worker processes (recommended: 2 × number of CPU cores).
-b 0.0.0.0:5000 → Binds to 0.0.0.0:5000 so it listens on all interfaces.
app:app → app is the filename (app.py), and app is the Flask instance
